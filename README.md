# Name: EventEase

# Project Description
College students and local communities often have trouble finding and managing events. Many events go unnoticed due to poor promotion and scattered information across different platforms. Without a central hub, it’s easy to miss out. Students also lose networking opportunities because they don’t know who else is attending.
